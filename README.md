Sweet Spot is a marketplace for pastry chefs and small bakeries and restaurants to share their baked goods with their community. It was made to bring communities together and to highlight smaller businesses.

This was my final project at Flatiron School and is a combination of Rails, React, Redux, Thunk, JWT, and the Stripe API. 

This repository contains the database and backend structure necessary to correctly run the entire Sweet Spot project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
* You have installed the latest version of `Rails 6.0.2.1`
* You have also cloned the frontend found at  `https://github.com/mwong068/sweet-spot-front-end`.
* In order to run this project you will need to grab a test API key from the Stripe API here: `https://dashboard.stripe.com/register`

You can create a .env file and place the key in like so:

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=(place key in here without parentheses)


## Using Sweet Spot

To use Sweet Spot, follow these steps:

```
bundle install
```

then

```
rails server
```

Ensure that this server is running before you attempt to start the front end.

Please let me know if you have any trouble getting this to correctly work.
