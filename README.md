# Sweet Spot

This contains the database and backend structure necessary to correctly run the entire Sweet Spot project.

In order to run this project you will need to grab a test API key from the Stripe API here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/register

You can create a .env file and place the key in like so:

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=(place key in here without parentheses)

After taking care of that, you can go ahead and

bundle install

then

rails server

You should be up and running at that point and able to connect with the front end.

Please let me know if you have any trouble getting this to correctly work.

Otherwise, enjoy!
